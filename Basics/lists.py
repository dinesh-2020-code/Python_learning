    Lists in Python: Enclosed in Square brackets
    Diff b/w strings and lists: Strings are immutable while lists are mutable

    Immutable: An object that can't be changed
        ex: int, float, bool, str, tuple, frozenset, bytes
        like int '5' can't be changed, 5 is only 5, you can add int '1' to it, we wil get int '6' which is new int

    Methods and functions.

    A method is the same as a function, except that it's bound to an object
    That means we need an object, in order to call a method.
        for ex; s.append(x) # append() is a method which stating that it is called on sequence object.
            len(lst), min(lst) are functions
