In python all functions return the value.


Variables and Types: 
    When a program's running, everything the program needs ends up stored in the computer's memory. The program
    code itself will be stored in one area of memory, and the data it works on will also be stored somewhere in 
    the memory. 
    
    A variable is basically just a way to give a name to an area of memory, into which we can place certain values.
        Variables are created when they are first bound to a value, using =.

    defining a variable means to bind the value to a variable of specific type
